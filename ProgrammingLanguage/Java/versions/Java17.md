# **_Java 17 is a stable, LTS release_**

# Pattern Matching for switch (Preview - JEP 406)
This feature allows more readable and flexible switch expressions by introducing pattern matching. 
It was introduced as a preview feature in Java 17, allowing developers to match patterns in switch cases.
```
    static String describe(Object obj) {
        return switch (obj) {
            case Integer i -> "Integer: " + i;
            case String s -> "String: " + s;
            default -> "Unknown";
        };
    }
```
# Foreign Function & Memory API (Incubator - JEP 412)
This API introduces a new mechanism for interacting with native code (C libraries, etc.) and managing off-heap memory. 
It aims to replace the need for JNI (Java Native Interface) and offers better safety and performance.
The API allows Java programs to call functions in native libraries and manage memory outside the Java heap.
# Deprecating the Applet API (JEP 398)
The Applet API, which was used for embedding Java applications in web browsers, is officially deprecated in Java 17. 
The web has moved on to newer technologies like HTML5, JavaScript, and WebAssembly, making Applets obsolete.

# JVM Constant API (JEP 416)
This API provides a standard way to model constant values within the JVM, improving the interaction between Java code and JVM-level constants.
It also enhances the handling of constants used by tools like the javac compiler and the JVM runtime.

#  JVM Improvements and Performance Enhancements
Java 17 includes multiple performance improvements and JVM optimizations, such as:
New garbage collection options and improvements.
Enhanced startup time and reduced memory footprint.
Better performance for multi-threaded workloads.

#  New java.lang Features
java.lang.Record improvements: Records (introduced in Java 14) receive minor tweaks and performance enhancements in Java 17.
java.util Improvements: A variety of changes to collections, stream APIs, and the Optional class.
