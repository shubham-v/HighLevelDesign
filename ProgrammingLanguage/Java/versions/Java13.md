Text blocks provide a way to handle multi-line string literals more easily, without excessive escape sequences.

```
    String json = """
    {
        "name": "John",
        "age": 30
    }
    """;
```

        case THURSDAY, SATURDAY     -> 8;
        case WEDNESDAY              -> 9;
        default -> throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unexpected day: " + day);
    };
```

# Dynamic CDS Archives

- With Dynamic CDS Archives, the JDK automatically generates a CDS archive during the applicationâ€™s first execution, making the process more user-friendly.
