Java 21 is a long-term support (LTS) release, virtual threads), modern syntax (pattern matching, string templates), and enhanced interoperability (Foreign Function API)

# Virtual Threads (Preview in JDK 19 & 20, Now Stable in JDK 21)
virtual threads are lightweight and allow applications to handle a massive number of concurrent tasks with reduced resource consumption.
Benefits:
- Simplifies the development of high-throughput concurrent applications.
- Eliminates the need for thread pooling.
- Fully compatible with existing thread-based APIs.
- 
# Pattern Matching Enhancements
## Pattern Matching for switch (Finalized)
## Record Patterns (Finalized)
## Unnamed Patterns and Variables
Simplifies ignoring parts of patterns using _ as a placeholder.
```
    if (point instanceof Point(_, int y)) {
        System.out.println("Y-coordinate: " + y);
    }
```

# Sequenced Collections
**Description**: Introduces new interfaces (SequencedCollection, SequencedSet, and SequencedMap) that maintain insertion order.
**Benefits**:
- Provides a unified way to work with collections that maintain a sequence.
- Offers methods like reversed() and supports bidirectional traversal.
- 
# String Templates (Preview)
```
    String name = "Alice";
    int age = 30;
    String message = STR."Name: ${name}, Age: ${age}";
```

# Unnamed Classes and Instance Main Methods (Preview)\
Ideal for rapid prototyping and educational purposes.
```
    void main(String... args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, Java 21!");
    }
```

# Scoped Values (Preview)
# Foreign Function & Memory API (Finalized)
Replaces the outdated JNI with a simpler and more modern API.

# Deprecations and Removals
- The Thread.stop() method has been officially deprecated for removal.
- Older APIs marked for eventual removal to streamline the platform.

# Performance and JVM Improvements
    Improved Garbage Collection:
        Enhancements to ZGC and G1GC for better latency and throughput.
    JVM Start-up Time:
        Optimizations to reduce application startup times.
    Better Observability:
        Enhanced JDK Flight Recorder (JFR) capabilities for profiling and monitoring.

# Enhanced Security Features
Stronger encryption algorithms and updates to the default cryptographic configurations.
