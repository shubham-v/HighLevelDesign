# Record Patterns (Preview)
This feature enhances the Java programming language's ability to destructure record types (introduced in Java 14) 
with a more concise syntax. It allows for the use of pattern matching with records, enabling easier access to components 
and simplifying code.
```
    public class Main {
        record Point(int x, int y) {}
        
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Object obj = new Point(1, 2);
            
            if (obj instanceof Point(var x, var y)) {
                System.out.println("Point x = " + x + ", y = " + y);
            }
        }
    }
```

# JEP 422: Linux/AArch64 Port
This feature does not directly change how code is written, but it improves Java performance and stability on Linux AArch64. 
If youâ€™re running on this architecture, Java 19 will natively support it.

# JEP 424: Foreign Function & Memory API (Incubator)
This incubator feature aims to provide a safer and more efficient way for Java programs to interact with native code 
(e.g., C, C++) by accessing memory outside the Java heap and calling functions in native libraries, without relying on 
the Java Native Interface (JNI).
```
    import jdk.incubator.foreign.*;
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            try (MemorySegment segment = MemorySegment.allocateNative(4)) {
                segment.set(ValueLayout.JAVA_INT, 0, 123);
                int value = segment.get(ValueLayout.JAVA_INT, 0);
                System.out.println("Memory value: " + value);
            }
        }
    }
```

# JEP 427: Pattern Matching for Switch (Preview)
This example uses switch with pattern matching, making it easier to match and destructure values directly within the switch cases.
```
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Object obj = 42;
    
            String result = switch (obj) {
                case Integer i -> "Integer: " + i;
                case String s -> "String: " + s;
                default -> "Unknown type";
            };
    
            System.out.println(result);
        }
    }
```

# JEP 428: Structured Concurrency (Incubator)
The Structured Concurrency API simplifies working with threads by automatically managing the lifecycle of virtual threads. 
Here, Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor() creates a new virtual thread for a task.
```
    import java.util.concurrent.*;
    
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException {
            try (var executor = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()) {
                var future = executor.submit(() -> "Hello from Virtual Thread!");
                System.out.println(future.get());
            }
        }
    }
```

# JEP 429: Scoped Values (Incubator)
    Scoped Values (introduced in Java 19 as an incubator feature) provide a mechanism 
    to share immutable values across threads in a controlled, efficient, and thread-safe manner.
    efficient alternative to ThreadLocal.

    - Thread safety: Unlike ThreadLocal, ScopedValue is immutable, making it inherently thread-safe.
    - Efficiency: Scoped values avoid some of the pitfalls of ThreadLocal, such as memory leaks in thread pools.
    - Better scope control: Scoped values are tied to specific code regions, ensuring that their accessibility is limited 
        to only where they are explicitly declared.
    * ScopedValue: A container that holds an immutable value.
    * ScopedValue.Scope: Represents the scope of the value. The value can only be accessed when within this scope.
    
## UseCases
    - Share immutable context data (e.g., user information, request metadata) across threads in a structured and safe way.
    - Pass contextual information (like request IDs) for consistent logging without relying on ThreadLocal.
    - Manage access tokens, user roles, or other security-related data tied to specific tasks or requests.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Scoped values allow data to be scoped to a specific thread context. 
In this example, a ScopedValue is created and accessed within its scope.
```
    import jdk.incubator.concurrent.*;
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            var scope = new ScopedValue<>("ScopedValue", "Hello, World!");
            
            try (var scopeContext = ScopedValue.asContext(scope)) {
                System.out.println(scope.value());
            }
        }
    }
```
```
    import jdk.incubator.concurrent.ScopedValue;
    
    public class ScopedValueExample {
    
        // Define a ScopedValue instance (this acts like a "key")
        private static final ScopedValue<String> USERNAME = ScopedValue.newInstance();
    
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            // Define a scope and bind a value to it
            ScopedValue.where(USERNAME, "JohnDoe")
                    .run(() -> {
                        // Access the ScopedValue within its scope
                        System.out.println("Current User: " + USERNAME.get());
                        
                        // Nested scope
                        ScopedValue.where(USERNAME, "JaneDoe")
                                .run(() -> System.out.println("Nested User: " + USERNAME.get()));
                        
                        // Back to the original scope
                        System.out.println("Back to Original User: " + USERNAME.get());
                    });
    
            // Attempting to access ScopedValue outside its scope results in an error
            try {
                System.out.println(USERNAME.get());
            } catch (IllegalStateException e) {
                System.out.println("Cannot access ScopedValue outside its scope!");
            }
        }
    }
```

# JEP 376: ZGC: Concurrent Thread-Stack Processing (zgc)

and Java 19 now processes thread stacks concurrently, improving performance during garbage collection.
