# Improved Networking APIs
- Enhancements to HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 client libraries.
- Improved support for WebSocket protocols.
```
    // Create an HttpClient with HTTP/3 support enabled
        HttpClient httpClient = HttpClient.newBuilder()
                .version(HttpClient.Version.HTTP_3)
                .build();

    // Create a GET request to a URL that supports HTTP/3
    HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
            .uri(new URI("https://http3-test-server.example.com"))
            .GET()
            .build();

    // Send the request and get the response
    HttpResponse<String> response = httpClient.send(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());

# Vector API (Fifth Incubator)
The Vector API provides a mechanism for expressing vector computations, which can be executed efficiently on modern hardware:
```
    Vector<Integer> vector1 = IntVector.fromArray(SPECIES_PREFERRED, array1, 0);
    Vector<Integer> vector2 = IntVector.fromArray(SPECIES_PREFERRED, array2, 0);
    Vector<Integer> result = vector1.add(vector2);
    result.intoArray(arrayResult, 0);
```

# Platform-Specific Updates
Java 22 includes updates for better integration and performance on various platforms (Linux, Windows, macOS, etc.).

# Enhanced Diagnostics & Tooling
   Improved JFR (Java Flight Recorder) for profiling and diagnostics.
   Updates to the javadoc and javac tools for better developer experience. 

# Deprecations and Removals
Certain outdated APIs have been deprecated or removed.
Continued removal of legacy and unsafe features to streamline the platform.
