# JEP 376: ZGC: Concurrent Thread-Stack Processing
- The Z Garbage Collector (ZGC) received improvements in Java 16, specifically for concurrent processing of thread stacks. 
  This reduces stop-the-world pauses and improves overall GC performance.

# JEP 338: Vector API (Incubator)
The Vector API was incubated in Java 16, offering a way to write code that leverages SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) 
for high-performance computing, particularly for operations like array manipulations and mathematical calculations.

# JEP 396: Strongly Encapsulate JDK Internals by Default
This feature restricts access to internal APIs within the JDK, improving security and maintainability. 
Access to such internal APIs now requires the use of specific flags.
