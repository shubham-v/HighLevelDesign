# FR
1. One to one chat messaging
2. Group chat messaging
3. check the status of user or (last seen time)
4. check status of message (SENT/DELIVERED/SEEN)
5. Fetch previous messages
## Optional
6. Delete the messages on the chat (Delete for yourself, everyone)
7. Share media

# NFR
- High Availability
- High Consistency
    - Trade off consistency for availability -> EventualConsistency
- Low Latency -> Almost real time experience when messages are sent
- Reliability
  - Messages should be encrypted
  - Retrieve previous messages/chats

# Estimations
## Assumptions
Total: 50M
DAU: 10M 
Messages sent by use to others in single day = 500
Message size = 200bytes (2 bytes per character)
### Optional
1 media per DAU -> 10 request for media file

## QPS
- Read:Write = 1:1
- 10M * 500 per day 
  - = 5 * 10^10 / 10^5
  - = 5 * 10^5 bytes
  - = 500000 bytes ~= 5MB per sec Read
  - = 500000 bytes ~= 5MB per sec Write
  - Media -> 1000M * 10 = 10000 QPS for reads & seconds
## Capacity Planning (Next 1 year)
Messages = 10M * 500 * 365 * 300 bytes =  
Media = (10M * 1MB * 365) =

# Bottlenecks
## Websockets
1. avoids recreation connection agaon & again
2. stateful connection
3. uses hearbeat mechanism 
4. ttl: 
5. a connection can be upgraded via a load balancer to WebSocket, but you need to ensure that:
   - The load balancer supports WebSocket connections and is properly configured.
   - Session persistence is enabled if you're using multiple backend servers.
   - Both the client and server are properly configured to handle WebSocket connections.
