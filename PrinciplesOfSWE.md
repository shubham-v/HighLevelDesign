# SeperationOfConcerns
- Recognition of the need to work in limited context

# Modularity
- Seperating software into components according to functionality & responsibility.
- Specialized SoC

# Abstraction
- Seperate behavior from implementation
- What it does ? How it does ?
- Failure causes unnecessary coupling
- Design by contract is a methodology
- Specialized SoC

# Anticipation to Change
- It recognizes the complexity of the learning process for both soft developers & clientsyear
- Coupling is  major obstacle to change
- Cohesive components are easier to reuse when requirements change.

# Generality
- Essential to design s/w that is from unnatural restrictions & limitations
- Closely related to principle of anticipation of change
- e.g. two digit year

# Incremental Development
- Build s/w in small increments
- Simplify verification, deal with added portion
- Errors are partly isolated
- Handling change in requirements
- Likely to be changed processes towards end of development process

# Consistency
- Recognition of fact that it is easier to do things in familiar context
